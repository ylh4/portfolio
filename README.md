# Using data science for Peace

## About me

My name is Yared Hurisa. I am an applied scientist passionate about building data sceince products that could serve the disadvantaged populations in Africa and elswhere!

Born and raised in rural Ethiopia, I have been watching as my country makes the headlines on conflict and climate change induced disasters especially in recent years. The devastating impact of conflict in my country and the region is heartbreaking. Hence, for me, there is nothing like working on projects that reduce the impact of pressing issues such as conflict and climate change. This include include informing policies and programmes with data and data science tools.

With background in data science and international development. I use machine learning and deep learning applications to gain insights from data. My research broadly adress the following objectives:

    Forecasting conflict at sub-national level?
    Predicting the pattern and magnitude of forced displacement within and across countries?
    Detecting violence using online data

This github accounthosts my major contributions as a side projects that include:

- ðŸ”­ A personal [blog](http://www.datascienceforpeace.com/) application that serve as a foundation for continous learning and blogging.
- ðŸ”­ An [application](http://conflictforecastingmodel.herokuapp.com/) that uses machine learning technique to forecast conflict in Ethiopia.
- ðŸ”­ Posting [blogs](http://www.datascienceforpeace.com/blog) on periodic basis on conflict and climate change primarly in Ethiopia
